    "In this second practical, we will train neural network models to obtain sentence representations. We can then use these sentence representations for a downstream task such as sentiment classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will help you to develop models for your experiments. But this time, next to completing the notebook, **you are expected to write a four-page scientific report with your findings**. Please still submit the notebook together with your scientific report so that we can reproduce your experiments. (Note: if you find it useful, you can split this notebook into multiple notebooks. If you do so, keep it mind that it should be possible for your TAs to reproduce the entire content of the notebooks without having to ask for clarifications or to copy and paste functions from one sub-notebook to another.)\n",

    "### Data set\n",
    "We will use the [Stanford Sentiment Treebank](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/) (SST), which provides sentences, their binary tree structure, and fine-grained sentiment scores.\n",
    "This dataset is different from the one we used in the first practical. \n",
    "In Practical 1, a review consisted of several sentences, and we had one sentiment score for the whole review. Now, a review consists of a single sentence, and we have a sentiment score for each node in the binary tree that makes up the sentence, including the root node (i.e., we still have an overall sentiment score for the entire review). We will look at an example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this practical we will only make use of the sentence tokens whereas in the second part we will also exploit the tree structure that is provided by the SST.\n",

    "- Bag-of-words (BOW)\n",
    "- Continuous bag-of-words (CBOW)\n",
    "- Deep continuous bag-of-words (Deep CBOW)\n",

    "The Stanford Sentiment Treebank is a rather small data set, since it required fine-grained manual annotatation. This makes it difficult for the Deep CBOW model to learn good word embeddings, i.e. to learn good word representations for the words in our vocabulary.\n",
    "In fact, the only error signal that the network receives is from predicting the sentiment of entire sentences!\n",
    "\n",
    "To start off with better word representations, we can download **pre-trained word embeddings**. \n",
    "You can choose which pre-trained word embeddings to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GloVe**. The \"original\" Stanford Sentiment classification [paper](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P15/P15-1150.pdf) used Glove embeddings, which are just another method (like *word2vec*) to get word embeddings from unannotated text. Glove is described in the following paper which you should cite if you use them:\n",
    "> Jeffrey Pennington, Richard Socher, and Christopher Manning. [\"Glove: Global vectors for word representation.\"](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf) EMNLP 2014. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Word2Vec**. This is the method that you learned about in class, described in:\n",
    "> Mikolov, Tomas, et al. [\"Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality.\"](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf) Advances in neural information processing systems. 2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these pre-trained word embeddings, we can initialize our word embedding lookup table and start form a point where similar words are already close to one another in the distributional semantic space. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can choose to keep the word embeddings **fixed** or to train them further, specialising them to the task at hand.\n",
    "We will keep them fixed for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this lab, it is enough if you understand how word2vec works (whichever vectors you use), but if you are interested, we encourage you to also check out the GloVe paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either download the word2vec vectors, or the Glove vectors.\n",
    "If you want to compare your results to the Stanford paper later on, then you should use Glove. \n",
    "**At the end of this lab you have the option to compare which vectors give you the best performance. For now, simply choose one of them and continue with that.**\n",
    "\n",
    "[**OPTIONAL in case you don't want to mount Google Drive:** instead of running all the 5 boxes below, you can 1) download the GloVe and word2vec in your local machine, 2) upload them on your Drive folder (\"My Drive\"). Then, uncomment the first 2 lines in box 6 before writing your code!]\n"

    "Since we now use pre-trained word embeddings, we need to create a new vocabulary. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. We do not have pre-trained word embeddings for all words in our SST training set, and we do not want words in our vocabulary for which we have no word embeddings.\n",
    "2. We should be able to look up the pre-trained word embedding for words in the validation and test set, even if these words are unseen in training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, create a new vocabulary object `v` based on the word set of pre-trained embeddings, and load the corresponding embeddings into a list `vectors`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vocabulary `v` should consist of:\n",
    " - a  `<unk>` token at position 0,\n",
    " - a  `<pad>` token at position 1, \n",
    " - and then all words in the pre-trained embedding set.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "After storing each vector in a list `vectors`, turn the list into a numpy matrix like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    " vectors = np.stack(vectors, axis=0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to add new embeddings for the `<unk>` and `<pad>` tokens, as they're not part of the word2vec/GloVe embeddings. These embeddings can be randomly initialized or 0-valued, think about what makes sense and see what the effects are.\n",

    "#### Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "Data sparsity and a small data set can cause *overfitting*. This is a phenomenom that is very likely to occur when training strong and expressive models, like LSTMs, on small data. In practice, if your model overfits, this means that it will be very good at predicting (or \"remembering\") the sentiment of the training set, but unable to generalise to new, unseen data in the test set. This is undesirable and one technique to mitigate this issue is *dropout*. \n",
    "\n",
    "A dropout layer is defined by the following formula, which can be applied, for example, to a linear layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{tanh}(W(\\mathbf{h}\\odot \\mathbf{d}) + \\mathbf{b})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{d} \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$, with $d_j \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p)$, \n",
    "\n",
    "These formula simply means that we *drop* certain parameters during training (by setting them to zero). Which parameters we drop is stochastically determined by a Bernoulli distribution and the probability of each parameter being dropped is set to $p = 0.5$ in our experiments (see the previous cell of code where we define our output layer). A dropout layer can be applied at many different places in our models. This technique helps against the undesirable effect that a model relies on single parameters for prediction (e.g. if $h^{\\prime}_j$ is large, always predict positive). If we use dropout, the model needs to learn to rely on different parameters, which is desirable to obtain better generalisation to unseen data."

    "**Why is the LSTM so slow?** Despite our best efforts, we still need to make a lot of matrix multiplications per example (linear in the length of the example) just to get a single classification, and we can only process the 2nd word once we have computed the hidden state for the 1st word (sequential computation).\n",
    "\n",
    "GPUs are more efficient if we do a few big matrix multiplications, rather than lots of small ones. If we could process multiple examples at the same time, then we could exploit that. That is, we could still process the input sequentially, but doing so for multiple sentences at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to now our \"mini-batches\" consisted of a single example. This was for a reason: the sentences in our data sets have **different lengths**, and this makes it difficult to process them at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a batch of 2 sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "this movie is bad\n",

    "```\n",
    "2 3 4 5\n",
    "2 3 4 6 7 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot feed PyTorch an object with rows of variable length! We need to turn this into a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to add **padding values** to our mini-batch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "2 3 4 5 1 1\n",
    "2 3 4 6 7 8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a sentence is shorter than the longest sentence in a mini-batch, we just use a padding value (here: 1) to fill the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our computation, we should **ignore** the padding positions (e.g. mask them out) so that paddings do not contribute to the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mini-batch feed\n",

    "\n",
    "Make sure you cover at least the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How important is word order for this task?\n",
    "- Does the tree structure help to get a better accuracy?\n",
    "- How does performance depend on the sentence length? Compare the various models. Is there a model that does better on longer sentences? If so, why?\n",
    "- Do you get better performance if you supervise the sentiment **at each node in the tree**? You can extract more training examples by treating every node in each tree as a separate tree. You will need to write a function that extracts all subtrees given a treestring. \n",
    "    - Warning: NLTK's Tree function seems to result in invalid trees in some cases, so be careful if you want to parse the string to a tree structure before extraction the phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To obtain a full grade, you should conduct further investigations.** For example, you can also investigate the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When making a wrong prediction, can you figure out at what point in the tree (sentence) the model fails? You can make a prediction at each node to investigate.\n",
    "- How does N-ary Tree LSTM compare to the Child-Sum Tree LSTM? \n",
    "- How do the Tai et al. Tree LSTMs compare to Le & Zuidema's formulation?\n",
    "- Or... your own research question!\n",
    "\n",
    "In general:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***When you report numbers, please report the mean accuracy across 3 (or more) runs with different random seed, together with the standard deviation.*** This is because the final performance may vary per random seed. \n",
    "More precisely, you should run each model with 3 different seeds, and for each of these 3 runs, evaluate the best model (according to the validation) on the test dataset. The validation dataset is used for finding the best model over iterations, but the accuracy you report should be on the test dataset.\n",

    "- Efficient delivery of (only) the facts that we need to know to understand/reimplement\n",
    "- Results visually well-presented and described with the correct priority of importance of sub-results\n",
    "- Insightful analysis – speculation should connect to something interesting and not be too much; the reader “learns something new”\n",
    "- No typos, no colloquialisms – well-considered language\n",
